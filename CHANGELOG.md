# counterfact

## 2.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 0043b20: Add support for a `counterfact.yaml` config file. All CLI options can now be specified in a `counterfact.yaml` file in the current working directory. Command-line options always take precedence over config file settings. Use `--config <path>` to load a config file from a non-default location.
- 2cbd0d5: Add .empty() method to response builder for responses with no body
- 965dc4e: Add `.apply` REPL dot-command (Approach 1: Minimalist Function Injection).

  The `.apply` command lets you run scenario scripts from the REPL prompt without leaving the terminal. A scenario is a plain TypeScript (or JavaScript) file that exports named functions. Each function receives an `ApplyContext` object with `{ context, loadContext, routes, route }` and can freely read or mutate state.

  **Path resolution:**

  | Command              | File                   | Function |
  | -------------------- | ---------------------- | -------- |
  | `.apply foo`         | `scenarios/index.ts`   | `foo`    |
  | `.apply foo/bar`     | `scenarios/foo.ts`     | `bar`    |
  | `.apply foo/bar/baz` | `scenarios/foo/bar.ts` | `baz`    |

  The `ApplyContext` type is written to `types/apply-context.ts` during code generation.

- a356bdf: Validate response headers at runtime and report type errors as `response-type-error` HTTP headers (one per error, multiple headers with the same name). Use --no-validate-response to disable.

### Patch Changes

- 54b866c: add docs/usage-patterns.md documenting seven usage patterns: explore a new API, simulate failures and edge cases, mock APIs with dummy data, fast sandbox for agentic coding, hybrid proxy, API reference implementation, and executable spec
- 6e0655b: fix type error when returning a response with no body (e.g. `$.response[200]` or `$.response[404]` in routes where the spec defines no response body)
- 754dbbd: add two new usage pattern docs: Automated Integration Tests (programmatic API in test suites) and Custom Middleware (\_.middleware.ts for cross-cutting concerns); propose three future patterns as GitHub issues: Record and Replay, Webhook Simulation, and Persistent State
- f9a9790: Refactor `src/counterfact-types/` so that each type lives in its own file with a JSDoc comment explaining its purpose. The `index.ts` now re-exports all types from the individual files. This is an internal refactor with no change to the public API.
- 6d50ae6: Updated dependency `ajv` to `8.18.0`.
- fa25ec3: Updated dependency `@swc/core` to `1.15.24`.
- cbab929: Updated dependency `eslint` to `10.2.0`.
- 9c5fc1d: Replace deprecated `unescape()` with `decodeURIComponent()` wrapped in a try/catch in `requirement.ts`. This avoids use of the deprecated global function while preserving the behavior of returning invalid percent-encoded sequences unchanged.
- 323cf1c: Revised documentation for coherence: added table of contents to usage, reference, and FAQ pages; added "See also" sections to pages that were missing them; moved the usage guide link from the README footer into the "Go deeper" table.

## 2.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 3b0334a: Add JSDoc comment generation for types from OpenAPI metadata

  Generated TypeScript types now include inline JSDoc comments derived from the OpenAPI spec:
  - Schema-level JSDoc from `description`/`summary`
  - Property-level JSDoc including `description`, `@example`, `@default`, `@format`, and `@deprecated`
  - Operation-level JSDoc from operation `summary`/`description`

  This improves IDE hover documentation and AI-assisted development workflows.

- a3b24f0: Add request validation against the OpenAPI spec. Incoming requests are now validated by default — missing required query parameters, missing required headers, and request bodies that do not match the declared schema all result in a 400 response with a descriptive error message. Validation can be disabled with the `--no-validate-request` CLI flag.
- 3c5c284: Add lightweight telemetry using PostHog to track usage of Counterfact. Fires a single `counterfact_started` event on startup. Telemetry is disabled by default before May 1, 2026, disabled in CI, and can be controlled with the `COUNTERFACT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` environment variable. A one-time warning is shown before the rollout date.
- 6c9e30f: Add REPL-native request builder (`route()`) with fluent API, OpenAPI introspection, and autocomplete support.

  The new `route()` function is available in the REPL and allows users to discover, construct, and execute API requests interactively:

  ```js
  const pet = route("/pet/{petId}").method("get").path({ petId: 1 });

  await pet.send();
  ```

  Key capabilities:
  - Fluent, immutable builder API (`.method()`, `.path()`, `.query()`, `.headers()`, `.body()`)
  - OpenAPI-backed introspection via `.help()`, `.ready()`, and `.missing()`
  - Actionable feedback when required parameters are absent
  - Custom REPL display showing parameter status
  - Autocomplete for `route("` in addition to existing `client.*` patterns

### Patch Changes

- 7a89d27: Refactor internal plain objects to Maps where appropriate:
  - `Directory.directories` and `Directory.files` in `module-tree.ts` are now `Map<string, Directory>` and `Map<string, File>`
  - `ParameterTypes` inner types in `dispatcher.ts` are now `Map<string, string>`
  - `castParameters` in `registry.ts` now accepts `Map<string, string>` for parameter types
- 5b7d8b3: Improve error messages for malformed or missing OpenAPI specs. Instead of showing a JavaScript stack trace, Counterfact now displays a clear, actionable message that includes the spec path and the underlying reason for the failure.
- ff2ba80: Auto-detect TypeScript native runtime support (tsx, ts-node, node --experimental-strip-types) instead of requiring a --use-tsx flag

## 2.5.1

### Patch Changes

- a10ac3d: Convert remaining JavaScript source files and tests to TypeScript with proper types

## 2.5.0

### Minor Changes

- f440a20: Display the current version on startup and warn when a newer version is available on npm. The version check runs non-blocking in the background after the server starts, and can be suppressed with `--no-update-check` or by setting the `CI` environment variable.

### Patch Changes

- cdb4c42: Fix import path in generated route handler files when the OpenAPI path contains a colon (e.g. `/stuff:action`). Previously, the import statement used a literal `:` but the type file was written to disk with the Unicode ratio symbol `∶` (U+2236), causing TypeScript to fail to resolve the type and fall back to `any`.
- eb65932: Fix `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` CORS header to reflect only the HTTP methods actually implemented by the route handler, instead of hardcoding `GET,HEAD,PUT,POST,DELETE,PATCH` for every route.
- d522f6f: Fix crash when a route file is deleted while the server is running. Previously, the file-watch handler would attempt to re-import the deleted file after removing it from the registry, causing a `TypeError`. Now the handler returns immediately after processing the `unlink` event.
- d306720: Fix crash when a route file has a syntax error. Previously, Counterfact would crash with an unhandled promise rejection when a CommonJS route file had a syntax error. Now the server stays running and requests to that route return a 500 response with a message indicating which file has the error.
- 6ca6998: Fix request body parsing: `RawHttpClient` now automatically sets `Content-Type: application/json` when the body is an object, so `$.body` is populated correctly in route handlers.
- df8abcf: Fix TypeError when a response content entry has no schema defined. Previously, the TypeScript type generator would crash with `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'data')` and emit an empty error comment type. Now it gracefully falls back to `unknown` for the body type.
- 37dec24: Updated dependency `koa` to `3.2.0`.
- a1973c7: Updated dependency `lodash` to `4.18.1`.

## 2.4.0

### Minor Changes

- cb931d6: When multiple wildcard route handlers exist at the same path level (e.g. `/{x}` and `/{y}` as siblings), Counterfact now:
  1. Logs an error to stderr at load time listing the conflicting wildcard names.
  2. Returns an HTTP 500 response when a request could be routed to two or more handlers due to the ambiguity.

- 0a3039b: Add support for binary data in responses. Route handlers can now return binary content using the new `binary()` method on the response builder, which accepts a `Buffer` or a base64-encoded string. OpenAPI schemas with `format: "binary"` (v3) or `type: "file"` (v2) now generate `Buffer | string` TypeScript types.
- d53f4c3: Break REPL out of `counterfact()` and expose it as a callable `startRepl()` on the returned object. This enables programmatic usage (e.g. from Playwright tests) without automatically starting an interactive terminal session.

  ```ts
  import { counterfact } from "counterfact";

  const { contextRegistry, start, startRepl } = await counterfact(config);
  await start(config);

  // Manipulate server state directly from test code:
  const rootContext = contextRegistry.find("/");
  rootContext.passwordResponse = "expired";
  ```

  The CLI (`bin/counterfact.js`) now explicitly calls `startRepl()` when `--repl` is passed, preserving existing behaviour.

- 861c4db: Add route autocomplete to REPL for `client.<method>("...")` patterns.

  When typing `client.get("/p` in the REPL and pressing Tab, the REPL now suggests available routes (e.g. `/pets`, `/pets/{petId}`) derived from the route registry.

  This works for all HTTP methods: `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, and `delete`.

- 1e4d5cf: Add chainable `$.response.cookie()` helper for setting response cookies.

  Route handlers can now set one or more cookies without manually building `Set-Cookie` header strings:

  ```ts
  return $.response[200]
    .cookie("sessionId", "abc123", {
      httpOnly: true,
      secure: true,
      sameSite: "lax",
      path: "/",
      maxAge: 3600,
    })
    .cookie("theme", "dark")
    .json({ ok: true });
  ```

  Supported options: `path`, `domain`, `maxAge`, `expires`, `httpOnly`, `secure`, `sameSite`.

### Patch Changes

- 578faab: Fix REPL tab completion for built-in Node.js completions (e.g. `context.<Tab>`).

  The custom route completer previously replaced Node's built-in REPL completer entirely, breaking property completion for objects like `context` and `client`. The completer now delegates to the built-in completer when the input doesn't match the `client.<method>("...")` pattern.

- 76d3103: Updated dependency `json-schema-faker` to `0.6.0`.
- 4229034: Updated dependency `eslint` to `10.0.3`.
- 635071c: Updated dependency `eslint-plugin-jest` to `29.15.1`.
- ff36c53: Updated dependency `handlebars` to `4.7.9`.
- 9e2b147: Updated dependency `typescript` to `6.0.2`.
- 7f9ce73: Updated dependency `@swc/core` to `1.15.21`.
- a7a56a2: Updated dependency `eslint` to `10.1.0`.

## 2.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 2fc3033: Added `--prune` option to remove route files that no longer exist in the OpenAPI spec.

  When an OpenAPI spec renames a path parameter (e.g. `/pet/{id}/update/{Name}` → `/pet/{id}/update/{nickname}`), running without `--prune` leaves the old file in place alongside the newly generated one, causing wildcard ambiguity in route matching. The new flag cleans up defunct route files before generation runs.

  ```sh
  npx counterfact openapi.yaml ./out --generate --prune
  ```

  Context files (`_.context.ts`) and empty directories are handled correctly — context files are never pruned, and any directories left empty after pruning are removed automatically.

### Patch Changes

- eb72148: Add --spec flag as alternative to positional OpenAPI argument
- 79b4936: fixed a regression causing all 200 responses to be just "ok"
- 9a8dc4a: Add utility function for loading JSON files
- 86c4460: Updated dependency `@types/koa` to `3.0.2`.
- 1d08f75: Fill in required response headers in `random()`. When an OpenAPI response definition marks a header as `required: true`, the `random()` function now automatically generates a value for that header using the header's schema. Headers that are already set are not overwritten.

## 2.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 304cbfe: Add `example(name)` method to response builder for selecting named OpenAPI examples

  Developers can now select a specific named example from the OpenAPI specification using the strongly-typed `example()` method on a response builder:

  ```ts
  return $.response[200].example("namedExample1");
  ```

  The method is fully type-safe: TypeScript will autocomplete the example names defined in the OpenAPI document and report a type error if an unknown name is used.

  Example names are collected from the `examples` field of each media type in the response content (OpenAPI 3.x). The method can be chained with other response builder methods:

  ```ts
  return $.response[200]
    .example("namedExample1")
    .header("some-header", "some-value");
  ```

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 008f133: Admin API and Agent Skill
- 23b219b: format JSON in HTTP responses for readability

### Patch Changes

- c92f975: Fixed Midleware matching all routes is not executed #1515
- 86f1de2: Return HTTP 405 (Method Not Allowed) with an `Allow` header when the requested path is registered but the HTTP method has no handler. Previously these requests returned 404, making it impossible to distinguish "path not found" from "method not allowed".

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- ca69418: adds a notice linking to important discussion: https://github.com/pmcelhaney/counterfact/discussions/1527

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 3a7046b: Sanitize `operationId` values before using them as TypeScript identifiers in generated code.

  Previously, any `operationId` from an OpenAPI spec was used verbatim, which could produce invalid TypeScript when the value contained hyphens, dots, spaces, or other characters not permitted in identifiers. The value is now converted to camelCase (e.g. `get-user-profile` → `getUserProfile`) and any remaining invalid characters are stripped.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 56ddbfe: BREAKING: Updates route types to use operationId for more explicit route types and operation types.
  Why: Presently the routes generated from the OpenApi specification all use the same exported type of HTTP*{method} such as HTTP_GET and HTTP_POST. When you open those types, the path parameters, query parameters and headers are just inline types in the parent exported class. Some of our users desired the inline types to be explicit so that they can use the generated query types in other places. Our first change was just to add explicit types to the query parameters, but in working through the change it made more sense to go ahead and also add types for the path parameters and headers. Then since those new types will attempt to use the operationId from the spec if it is available, it made sense to make the entire route type more unique to that operationId instead of all the routes using HTTP_GET, HTTP_POST, HTTP_DELETE, etc.
  What you need to do: On launch Counterfact will run a migration script to migrate all your existing routes to the new types. You will need to pay attention to the output after your first run to be sure the upgrade was correct. In the unlikely event that an end user has other places in their code where they directly reference the HTTP* types those will need to be manually updated.

### Patch Changes

- e82c2ce: Fix incorrect required property type generation in schema-type-coder

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 70b2855: Added explicit parameter type exports for query parameters, path parameters, and headers. Operation types now export separate named types (e.g., `findPetsByStatus_Query`, `getPetById_Path`, `authenticate_Headers`) when parameters exist and use the operationId from your OpenAPI specification. These types can be imported and reused elsewhere in your code. The main operation types (HTTP_GET, HTTP_POST, etc.) remain unchanged for backward compatibility.

  Example:

  ```typescript
  import type {
    HTTP_GET,
    findPetsByStatus_Query,
  } from "./types/paths/pet.types.ts";

  // Use the query type elsewhere
  function validateQuery(query: findPetsByStatus_Query) {
    // ...
  }
  ```

## 0.27.0

### Minor Changes

- 836b61d: Fixed an issue where the context object wasn't working as expected.

  BREAKING CHANGE:
  - the main $.context.ts file needs an extra line: `export type ContextType = Context;`
  - $.context.ts files below the root need to change to `export type { ContextType } from "../$.context";`
  - if you modified any of the $.context.ts files below the root, treat the first bullet applies

  When you run Counterfact, it will try to make these changes for you, so ideally you won't have to worry about it.
