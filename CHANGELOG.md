# counterfact

## 0.30.0

### Minor Changes

- 0dc11ea: added a --prefix option to specify prefix from which routes are served (e.g. /api/v1)

### Patch Changes

- 4de94f0: Update dependency @types/jest to v29.5.7
- 5f8e97b: chore(deps): update dependency @types/jest to v29.5.8

## 0.29.0

### Minor Changes

- 0069e9b: The list of routes on on the dashboard (http://localhost:3100/counterfact) is now determined on the fly
- 0069e9b: Regenerate code if the OpenAPI file changes while Counterfact is running
- f89691a: configure json-schema-faker to create between 0 and 20 items when it generates an array

## 0.28.0

### Minor Changes

- 33d05f9: configure json-schema-aker to create between 0 and 20 items when it generates an array

## 0.27.1

### Patch Changes

- 7eba726: got a little carried away with typeof; it's needed for the instance, not the class

## 0.27.0

### Minor Changes

- 836b61d: Fixed an issue where the context object wasn't working as expected.

  BREAKING CHANGE:

  - the main $.context.ts file needs an extra line: `export type ContextType = Context;`
  - $.context.ts files below the root need to change to `export type { ContextType } from "../$.context";`
  - if you modified any of the $.context.ts files below the root, treat the first bullet applies

  When you run Counterfact, it will try to make these changes for you, so ideally you won't have to worry about it.
