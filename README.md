<h2>Mock servers work—until you need state, failures, or control mid-run.</h2>
</div

Static responses aren’t enough. There’s no shared state. You can’t inject failures. You can’t test real workflows.<br>
Mock servers make it easy to get started, but hard to keep going.<br>
Counterfact is an API simulator without those limits. 

Point it at an [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org) document and get a live, stateful API in seconds. 
- Type-safe TypeScript handlers for every endpoint  
- Hot reloading as you edit  
- Shared state across routes  
- **A built-in REPL to control behavior at runtime**  
- Optional proxying to real backends

Flexbile for humans. Stable for [AI agents](https://github.com/counterfact/api-simulator/blob/main/docs/patterns/ai-assisted-implementation.md).

You’re in control—without restarting.

For a *frontend developer* waiting on a backend,<br>
a *test engineer* who needs clean, reproducible state,<br>
or an *AI agent* that needs a stable API

Real enough to be useful. Fake enough to be usable.
