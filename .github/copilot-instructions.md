# Copilot Instructions for Counterfact

## Manual Acceptance Tests

Every PR description must include a section titled exactly `## Manual acceptance tests` with 3–6 unchecked checkboxes. Each checkbox must describe an observable behavior (not an implementation detail), and must not be pre-checked — they are for the human reviewer.

- Cover the main success path, at least one edge case, and one regression check where applicable.
- Example:
  - [ ] `GET /hello/{name}` returns 200 with expected response body
  - [ ] Invalid example name returns 500
  - [ ] Existing routes without examples behave unchanged

**Exception:** When the PR only adds issue proposal files under `.github/issue-proposals/`, the acceptance tests section may be omitted. The CI workflow processes proposal files automatically on merge.

## File System Operations in Tests

When tests need to read or write files, use `usingTemporaryFiles()` from the `using-temporary-files` package (already a devDependency). Never import `node:fs`, `fs`, `node:fs/promises`, or `fs/promises` directly in test files.

The `$` helper provides:
- `$.add(relativePath, contents)` — create or overwrite a file
- `$.addDirectory(relativePath)` — create a directory
- `$.read(relativePath)` — read a file's contents (returns `Promise<string>`)
- `$.remove(relativePath)` — delete a file
- `$.path(relativePath)` — resolve an absolute path within the temporary directory (use this when passing paths to the code under test)

```ts
import { usingTemporaryFiles } from "using-temporary-files";

it("example", async () => {
  await usingTemporaryFiles(async ($) => {
    await $.add("input.json", JSON.stringify({ key: "value" }));
    const result = await myFunction($.path("input.json"));
    const output = await $.read("output.txt");
    expect(output).toBe("expected content");
  });
});
```

## Before Committing

- Run `yarn lint:fix` to auto-fix linting issues, then `yarn lint` to confirm no remaining errors.
- Include a changeset (`npx changeset`) for any user-facing change.
- When touching server startup or CLI behaviour, run the black-box tests: `yarn build` then `yarn test:black-box` (requires Python 3 with `pip install -r test-black-box/requirements.txt`).

## Context

Counterfact is a TypeScript-based mock server generator that transforms OpenAPI/Swagger specifications into live, stateful mock APIs with hot reload, a terminal REPL, and a built-in Swagger UI. Developers run it with a single command and receive fully typed route-handler files they can edit while the server is running.

```bash
npx counterfact@latest https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json api
```

## Proposing New GitHub Issues

When planning work that requires new GitHub issues, follow the conventions in:

```
.github/instructions/issue-proposals.instructions.md
```

Key rules:

- **Never** create GitHub issues directly via the API, browser automation, or any other means.
- **Always** propose new issues as Markdown files under `.github/issue-proposals/`.
- Use YAML front matter for metadata (`title`, `parentIssue`, `labels`, `assignees`, `milestone`).
- Include `parentIssue` in front matter whenever you know the parent issue number.
- Write clear issue bodies with a summary, context/motivation, and acceptance criteria.

Proposal files are merged via a pull request and converted into real issues automatically on merge.
