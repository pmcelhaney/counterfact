When the backend isn't ready, development doesn't have to stop. Counterfact reads an OpenAPI spec, generates TypeScript handlers for every endpoint, and starts a live, stateful server. Handlers share state across routes, hot-reload when you edit them, and return schema-valid responses from the first request. You can program them to behave exactly as the real backend should.

The built-in REPL is where Counterfact goes further than any other mock server. With the server running in the terminal, you can inspect context, seed data, simulate failures, and toggle a proxy to the real backend—without restarting. It's a runtime control surface for a simulated API, and it's just as useful for test engineers who need reproducible states and AI coding agents that need a stable sandbox to iterate in.

```sh
npx counterfact@latest https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json api
