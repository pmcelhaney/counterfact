Counterfact is the API simulator that doesn't plateau. Give it an OpenAPI spec: it generates a typed TypeScript server with hot reload, shared state across routes, and schema-valid defaults from the first request. That's where other tools stop.

The built-in REPL is what sets it apart. While the server is running you can inspect and modify state, seed test data, trigger failure modes, and toggle a proxy to the real backend—from the terminal, without restarting. This runtime control surface is what static mock servers lack, and it matters most when you're working alongside AI coding agents that need a programmable, reproducible API environment to iterate effectively.

```sh
npx counterfact@latest https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json api
```

> Requires Node ≥ 22.0.0
