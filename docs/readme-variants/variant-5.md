Counterfact turns an OpenAPI spec into a stateful, programmable API server. One command starts it. A REPL lets you control it while it's running.

Traditional mocks return static responses. Counterfact generates TypeScript handlers you can edit live, maintains shared state across routes, and hot-reloads without losing that state. The built-in REPL is the differentiator: seed data, simulate errors, proxy to a real backend—without restarting. It's the right sandbox for frontend development, integration testing, and AI coding agents that need a reliable API to work against.

```sh
npx counterfact@latest https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json api
```

> Requires Node ≥ 22.0.0
