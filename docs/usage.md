# Usage

Counterfact is three tools in one:

- a **code generator** that converts an [OpenAPI](https://support.smartbear.com/swaggerhub/docs/tutorials/openapi-3-tutorial.html) document to [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) route files
- a **mock server** optimized for front-end development workflows
- a **live REPL** for inspecting and manipulating server state at runtime

This page is your map to the documentation.
