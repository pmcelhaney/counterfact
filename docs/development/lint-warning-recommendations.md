# Lint warning recommendations

Baseline (2026-04-16): `yarn lint` reports 123 warnings across 8 rules.

| Rule | Warnings | Recommendation | Why |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `security/detect-non-literal-fs-filename` | 50 | Selectively fix or ignore violations | Most hits are expected dynamic paths in file-system tooling; keep the rule for signal, but use validation wrappers and targeted ignores where inputs are trusted. |
| `security/detect-object-injection` | 42 | Selectively fix or ignore violations | Many hits are dynamic key lookups on known maps. Keep the rule, but prefer `Map`/guarded access in risky paths and suppress known-safe cases. |
| `jest/no-conditional-in-test` | 17 | Selectively fix or ignore violations | Some conditionals are legitimate for shared test helpers/table-driven cases; rewrite simple cases, keep explicit ignores for intentional patterns. |
| `import/no-named-as-default-member` | 4 | Disable it | Current warnings are false-positive noise from `js-yaml` interop in tests; disabling improves signal-to-noise. |
| `regexp/prefer-named-capture-group` | 3 | Fix violations | Small, mechanical updates (`(?:...)` or named groups) improve readability and can be fixed quickly. |
| `jest/expect-expect` | 3 | Selectively fix or ignore violations | Some tests assert by expecting thrown errors/side effects through helpers; add explicit assertions where possible and ignore intentional patterns. |
| `security/detect-unsafe-regex` | 2 | Selectively fix or ignore violations | One warning is from tooling config; review each regex for ReDoS risk and suppress only proven-safe patterns. |
| `jest/no-disabled-tests` | 2 | Fix violations | Skipped tests should be either re-enabled or removed to avoid long-term blind spots. |

## Suggested priority

1. Fix now: `regexp/prefer-named-capture-group`, `jest/no-disabled-tests`
2. Selective cleanup: `security/*`, `jest/no-conditional-in-test`, `jest/expect-expect`
3. Disable: `import/no-named-as-default-member`
