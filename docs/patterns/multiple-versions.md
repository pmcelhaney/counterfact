# Multiple API Versions

You maintain more than one version of an API — for example `/v1/pets` and `/v2/pets` — and want a single route handler that adapts its behavior to the version currently serving the request rather than maintaining a separate, duplicated handler file for every version.

## Problem

Versioned APIs introduce change gradually: a new field in the response, a renamed parameter, a removed endpoint. Duplicating every handler for every version creates a maintenance burden and lets the versions drift. You need a way to share as much handler logic as possible across versions while still making version-specific adjustments in the places that actually changed.

## Solution

Configure each versioned spec as a separate entry in the `specs` array passed to `counterfact()`. Give them the same `group` and different `version` labels. Counterfact generates a shared route file per path and injects two helpers into the handler's `$` argument at runtime:

- **`$.version`** — a string identifying which version is handling the request (e.g. `"v1"`, `"v2"`).
- **`$.minVersion(min)`** — returns `true` when the current version is at or after `min` in the declared version order.

Version order is determined by the position of each spec in the `specs` array — first entry is the oldest version.

Write one handler that branches on version using `$.minVersion()` instead of duplicating the file.

## Example

### Configuration

```ts
import { counterfact } from "counterfact";

const { start } = await counterfact(config, [
  { source: "./api-v1.yaml", group: "pets", version: "v1" },
  { source: "./api-v2.yaml", group: "pets", version: "v2" },
  { source: "./api-v3.yaml", group: "pets", version: "v3" },
]);

await start(config);
// Handlers are served at:
//   http://localhost:8100/pets/v1/...
//   http://localhost:8100/pets/v2/...
//   http://localhost:8100/pets/v3/...
```

### Handler

```ts
// pets/routes/pets/{petId}.ts
import type { HTTP_GET } from "../../types/paths/pets/{petId}.types.js";

export const GET: HTTP_GET = ($) => {
  const pet = $.context.getById($.path.petId);
  if (!pet) return $.response[404].text("Pet not found");

  // v1 returns only id and name
  if (!$.minVersion("v2")) {
    return $.response[200].json({ id: pet.id, name: pet.name });
  }

  // v2 adds the status field
  if (!$.minVersion("v3")) {
    return $.response[200].json({ id: pet.id, name: pet.name, status: pet.status });
  }

  // v3 adds the full pet object including photoUrls
  return $.response[200].json(pet);
};
```

`$.minVersion("v2")` returns `true` for requests handled by v2 and v3, and `false` for v1. The conditions layer naturally: the last `return` in the example only runs when v3 or later is handling the request.

### TypeScript narrowing

`$.minVersion()` is a type predicate. After a passing check, TypeScript narrows `$` to the intersection of only the versions that satisfy the minimum, giving you accurate autocompletion and type errors for version-specific fields:

```ts
export const GET: HTTP_GET = ($) => {
  if ($.minVersion("v2")) {
    // $ is now typed as the v2 (or v3, v4, …) $ type
    // v2-only fields are available here
  }
};
```

## Consequences

- A single route file covers all versions; shared logic is not duplicated across version directories.
- `$.minVersion()` expresses "this feature exists in version X and later" clearly at the point in the code where it matters.
- Adding a new version only requires adding its spec to the `specs` array and updating the handlers that actually changed — handlers that did not change continue to work across all versions.
- Handlers that differ fundamentally between versions can still be split across version-specific files if that is clearer; the pattern does not require all logic to live in one file.
- `$.version` and `$.minVersion()` are only present when `version` is set in the spec config. For a single, unversioned spec they are absent.

## Related Patterns

- [Executable Spec](./executable-spec.md) — run all version handlers as automated contract tests to confirm the spec and implementation stay in sync
- [Mock APIs with Dummy Data](./mock-with-dummy-data.md) — the baseline approach for populating responses this pattern extends
- [Federated Context Files](./federated-context.md) — share a single context across all versions of an API group so they see the same state
