# Executable Spec

You are designing an API and want immediate feedback on how each change to the spec affects the behavior of the running server and the clients that depend on it.

## Problem

API design happens in a document — the OpenAPI spec — while the feedback comes much later, when clients are built and integrated. By then, mistakes in the spec are expensive to fix.

## Solution

Run Counterfact with `--watch` while authoring the spec. Every time you save the spec, types regenerate and the server reflects the updated contract instantly. You can send real requests to observe how a spec change would behave, and TypeScript surfaces any handler that no longer matches the updated contract — while the server is still running.

## Example

Start with a spec for a pet clinic API and run Counterfact in watch mode:

```sh
npx counterfact@latest openapi.yaml api --watch
```

Now add a new `Vaccination` component to the spec and attach vaccination records to the `Pet` schema:

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Vaccination:
      type: object
      properties:
        vaccine:
          type: string
        date:
          type: string
          format: date
    Pet:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
        name:
          type: string
        vaccinations:
          type: array
          items:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/Vaccination"
```

Save the file. Counterfact regenerates the types immediately. The GET `/pet/{petId}` handler's return type now includes `vaccinations`. Send a request and the response already includes the new field — no code change needed:

```
⬣> client.get("/pet/1")
{ status: 200, body: { id: 1, name: 'Fluffy', vaccinations: [{ vaccine: 'Rabies', date: '2024-03-15' }] } }
```

If a handler's existing return value is now structurally invalid given the spec change, your IDE highlights it immediately. You can iterate on the spec — adding fields, changing types, restructuring schemas — and see the downstream effects on handlers and responses before any client code is written.

## Consequences

- Feedback on spec changes is instantaneous: save the spec, observe the effect on the running server.
- Type warnings appear in the IDE when handlers no longer match the updated contract; the server keeps running during the transition.
- The pattern works best during early API design, when the spec is still fluid and the cost of mistakes is low.
- Handlers must be updated manually to produce semantically correct responses after spec changes; type checking only catches structural mismatches.

- [Explore a New API](./explore-new-api.md) — use a spec you didn't write to explore an existing API the same way
- [Mock APIs with Dummy Data](./mock-with-dummy-data.md) — serve realistic data while the spec is still evolving
